# FYS3150-4150
This folder contains the results of project 1, 2 and 3 for course FYS3150/4150, which is collaboration work from Liang and Emil.

## Folder structure

* The projects are split into two parts a *project nr. x* folder and a *test project nr. x*.
* The first folder contains all of the raw code from the project.
  * There is also a folder called *Results* which contains our plots and results from the runs with the data.
  * Within the first folder of the projects you will also find the PDF with the report.


## To run the test function with unittest the run code is for example:
> python -m unittest test_Analsysfunctions

*Without adding .py*

## For project 3 the code is in a jupyter notebook 
*For easy running* 
### All of the results and prints are in the same file
The only other python file is our own gradient boosting method which was only used to get a better understanding of gradient boosting.
